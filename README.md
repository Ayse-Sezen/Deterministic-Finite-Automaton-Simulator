# Deterministic-Finite-Automaton-Simulator
A DFA simulator in C++. This program takes an input file containing a definition of a DFA (including all states, alphabet, 
transitions, and input strings for DFA) and creates the DFA internally then runs the input strings through the DFA, which will 
either accept or reject each string.
Using the -v or -h options on the command line while runnning the simulator will generate help messages that detail how to use the
simulator, how to write the input .dfa file correctly, and will display the definition of your DFA.
